# Video Galaxy App using LitElement 

This project includes a sample component using LitElement with JavaScript.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Testing

This sample uses Karma, Chai, Mocha, and the open-wc test helpers for testing. See the [open-wc testing documentation](https://open-wc.org/testing/testing.html) for more information.

Tests can be run with the `test` script:

```bash
npm test
```

## Dev Server

This sample uses open-wc's [es-dev-server](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/tree/master/packages/es-dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. ES dev server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```

There is a development HTML file located at `/index.html` that you can view at http://localhost:8000/index.html.

## Editing

If you use VS Code, we highly reccomend the [lit-plugin extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin), which enables some extremely useful features for lit-html templates:
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Type-checking
  - Code completion
  - Hover-over docs
  - Jump to definition
  - Linting
  - Quick Fixes
  
  The project is setup to reccomend lit-plugin to VS Code users if they don't already have it installed.

## Linting

Linting of JavaScript files is provided by [ESLint](eslint.org). In addition, [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) is used to type-check and lint lit-html templates with the same engine and rules as lit-plugin.

The rules are mostly the recommended rules from each project, but some have been turned off to make LitElement usage easier. The recommended rules are pretty strict, so you may want to relax them by editing `.eslintrc.json`.

To lint the project run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting. It has been pre-configured according to the Polymer Project's style. You can change this in `.prettierrc.json`.

Prettier has not been configured to run when commiting files, but this can be added with Husky and and `pretty-quick`. See the [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) site for instructions.

## Bundling and minification

To lint the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate package in dist folder
